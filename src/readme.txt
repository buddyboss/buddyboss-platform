== Requirements ==

To run BuddyBoss Platform, we recommend your host supports:

* PHP version 7.2 or greater.
* MySQL version 5.6 or greater, or, MariaDB version 10.0 or greater.
* HTTPS support.

== Installation ==

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New'
2. Click 'Upload Plugin'
3. Upload the file 'buddyboss-platform-plugin.zip'
4. Activate 'BuddyBoss Platform' from your Plugins page.

== Setup ==

1. Visit 'BuddyBoss > Components' and adjust the active components to match your community. (You can always toggle these later.)
2. Visit 'BuddyBoss > Pages' and setup your directories and registration pages. We create a few automatically, but suggest you customize these to fit the flow and verbiage of your site.
3. Visit 'BuddyBoss > Settings' and take a moment to match BuddyBoss Platform's settings to your expectations. We pick the most common configuration by default, but every community is different.
4. Visit 'BuddyBoss > Help' for tutorials on further configuration.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use my existing WordPress theme? =

Yes! BuddyBoss Platform works out-of-the-box with most generic WordPress themes.

= Will this work on WordPress multisite? =

Yes! If your WordPress installation has multisite enabled, BuddyBoss Platform will support the global tracking of blogs, posts, comments, and even custom post types with a little bit of custom code.

Furthermore, BuddyBoss Platform can be activated and operate in just about any scope you need for it to:

* Activate at the site level to only load BuddyBoss Platform on that site.
* Activate at the network level for full integration with all sites in your network. (This is the most common multisite installation type.)
* Enable multiblog mode to allow your BuddyBoss Platform content to be displayed on any site in your WordPress Multisite network, using the same central data.
* Extend BuddyBoss Platform with a third-party multi-network plugin to allow each site or network to have an isolated and dedicated community, all from the same WordPress installation.
