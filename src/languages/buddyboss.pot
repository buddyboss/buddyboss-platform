"BuddyBoss Platform is a fork of <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/\" "

"compatible with BuddyPress data and most BuddyPress plugins. If you have "
"been using BuddyPress in the past, you should remove it as this is a full "
"replacement. We have improved almost every aspect of BuddyPress and added "
"many new features. Below are some highlights, but as you explore you will "

"BuddyBoss Platform is meant to be theme independent, meaning any generic "
"WordPress theme can use it, and then a custom theme just makes everything "
"extra nice. We have created an all new premium BuddyBoss Theme that styles "
"everything to look absolutely gorgeous. Because we now control the core "
"plugin framework, we are able to do much more advanced layouts in our theme "
"than before, and we think you will love the result. If you were previously "
"using <a href=\"https://www.buddyboss.com/product/boss-theme/\" "
"target=\"_blank\">Boss</a> theme or <a "
"href=\"https://www.buddyboss.com/product/onesocial-theme/\" "
