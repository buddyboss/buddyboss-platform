#Development Resources

In this video you will learn how to use our [resources website](https://www.buddyboss.com/resources/) and also how to search through our developer code reference and release notes. Note that the “Developer” tab has been renamed to “Code Reference” and moved to a sub-menu under the “Documentation” tab.
