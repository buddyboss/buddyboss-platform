#Font Icons

When developing your custom child theme, you may want to use icons from the theme's included icon font family. You can reference our official [font cheatsheet](https://www.buddyboss.com/resources/font-cheatsheet/) to see a list of all BuddyBoss icons included in the theme.

##Using a Font Icon

To use a font icon in HTML, you can add the following code:

<code>&lt;i class=&quot;bb-icon-activity&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code>

Repacing "bb-icon-activity" with the correct name from the [font cheatsheet](https://www.buddyboss.com/resources/font-cheatsheet/).
