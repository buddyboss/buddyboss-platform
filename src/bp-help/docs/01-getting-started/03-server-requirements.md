#Server Requirements

Required Server Software Packages
---------------------------------

*   PHP version 5.6 or greater - 7.1 or greater for optimal performance
*   MySQL version 5.6 or greater
*   WordPress version 4.5 or greater - We recommend installing WordPress manually and NOT via a hosting provider self-install (e.g. fantastico, softalicious, etc.)
*   Apache Module mod\_rewrite
*   PHP GD or imagick modules - WordPress will fail to create images and will NOT show an error
*   AllowOverride should be set to All in folders where .htaccess is located

Before Installing We Recommend
------------------------------

*   [bp_docs_link text="Backing up your database and files" slug="maintenance/backing-up-your-database-and-files.md"]
*   VPS Hosting or better - Social communities increase server resource load with each concurrently logged in user. Shared hosting will provide a very slow experience.
