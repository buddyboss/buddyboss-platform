#Translating Text and Labels

###BuddyBoss Platform

You might want to change the text, labels and notices seen throughout BuddyBoss Platform, for example if your site is in another language. This page explains how to use a language translation file to customize all text instances found in BuddyBoss Platform. You **do not** want to modify the text in the code of the actual plugin, as it will all be removed as soon as you update the plugin. You need to modify text using the included language translation files. This is the same method used in all WordPress plugins.

###Automatic Translation via Loco Translate

We recommend using [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) plugin to translate all text found in the BuddyBoss Platform language files.

##Troubleshooting

###I am unable to re-translate my plugin

After translating the plugin, when you go back to translate it again you might find that your translation file is no longer listed for the plugin. If this happens, in Loco Translate click on the plugin link and then click on the "Setup" tab. Click the "Reset Config" button. Now everything should work again.
