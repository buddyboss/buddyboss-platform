#Courses Index

In this tutorial you will learn how to configure the [LearnDash](https://learndash.idevaffiliate.com/111.html) Courses Index for BuddyBoss Theme. This is the directory that displays all the courses on your site. We have options to filter the courses by Date, Progress, Instructor and Category, and also to show labels that display the user's course progress status.
